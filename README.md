# Plotting questions

## question 1:

How can I move the legend of the interactive plot down and also display more than a single column? I could not get it to work so far https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/issues/3780

## question 2:

How can I choose a single color for the lines (maybe separate them by style per device) but highlight the individual lines / time segments of the lines with a matching ticket in i.e. red.

## question 3:

How can I create an interactive plot like the one above (for the periodicities) which also encompasses Question 2
